# Chatbot tutorial

This chatbot was what I was tasked to create while working on an Asset Management tool, so users who have assets that belong to the company could use the Chatbot to figure out FAQs and communicate with the system admin.

This repository accompanies [this youtube video](https://youtu.be/vTpk-PKZwTs), and works as an introduction to [react-chatbot-kit](https://fredrikoseberg.github.io/react-chatbot-kit-docs/)

I used the chatbot template from a developer I found on YouTube who provided the link to his project repository (https://fredrikoseberg.github.io/react-chatbot-kit-docs/)
